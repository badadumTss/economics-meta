abstract = {With fast development and application, the Internet of Things (IoT) brings more opportunities to business. This research aims to investigate how IoT could lead to a co-evolving business ecosystem rather than a supply chain. It develops the 6C framework to analyze the data collected from case companies, and identifies three patterns of IoT-based business ecosystem. It also provides a summary of practical implications to guide practitioners building an IoT-based business ecosystem.}
